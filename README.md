Please provide a description of your project here.

## TODO Items
Please note that in addition to writing your actual application code, you will have to make a few manual edits specific to the pando workflow.
You can find these items labeled with a `TODO:` comment in various autogenerated files but here is an explicit checklist:

1. Turn your new project into a git repo with the following commands:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "ðŸŒ³ Pando init"
   ```
2. For your `Dockerfile` in your ROOT dir, you will have to fill in whatever commands you want Docker to do before deploying.
   These commands will be executed during a `pando build` and can be used to build dependencies or simply move files. However please do NOT specify things 
   such as `USER`, `EXPOSE`, `ENTRYPOINT`, etc in the Dockerfile since you cannot query these things via the Kubernetes API so it makes auditing difficult.
3. (Optional) You may want to use the template `script/build` that can make the building stage simpler. This is useful for larger apps or for compiling
   before deploying, but it is not necessary. Feel free to remove `script/build` if you find out that it's not needed.
4. Write Helm charts in your `chart/` directory to define what Kubernetes resources you would like your app to use.
5. When you are ready to deploy to production, edit your `.pando.yaml` file to include a deployment context and any values you want to set in prod.
   Note that this means you have already set up a k8s namespace in the right k8s production cluster and are prepared to monitor your service's health.

   Also note that setting the `deployType: ci` label will cause a new deployment to production on merging to master. We strongly recommend using this workflow in order to push to production.

## Cleanup
Be sure to delete the `TODO:` comments from the various files after you have completed them. At this point, you should be able to do a fresh
```
pando build
pando deploy
```
without any errors! You can also run a `kubectl get pods` command and see your brand new app up and running on your local machine!

After you have made all these `TODO` edits, feel free to delete the entire `TODO: Items`, and `Cleanup` blocks in this `README` file. You should now
write in your actual README description for your project!
