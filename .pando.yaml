# targets defines the list of deployment targets for your application. All apps
# get a local target by default, which allows you to deploy it locally, on your
# laptop. You can also define additional targets for production deployments in
# our Kubernetes clusters.
targets:
  local:
    context: local
    namespace: default
    # values:
    #   backendIngressHost: tardigrade.local.rsglab.com
# This is an example of a remote deployment target. You will need to modify it
# to add your real namespace and context once you determine those.
# You can follow along with this wiki https://confluence.mailchimp.com/display/PANDO/Creating+a+new+namespace+in+Pando
# to create a namespace and context.
# This is
#  cluster2.prod:
#    context: cluster2.prod
#    namespace: your-namespace-here
#    deployType: ci
#    values:
#      backendIngressHost: tardigrade.platform.rsglab.com
# pando tests:
# define additional pando test suites here. For a suite named "foo",
# create a corresponding script in script/test-foo. Pando's CI pipeline
# will automatically run your tests against all pull requests and report the
# status back to the pull request.
# pando init automatically creates a pando-lint script for you. You can add
# as many additional test suites as you want.
